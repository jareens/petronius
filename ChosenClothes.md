<blockquote>This page shows the list of the clothes which were chosen. You can edit<br>
the choices as you like, see below, but remember that before exiting you<br>
should save the choices, otherwise they will not be recorded in the<br>
history archive and future choices will not take them into account.<br>
</blockquote><blockquote></p>
<p>
<blockquote>There are many ways to modify the proposed choices, one of them is to<br>
briefly press on a garment to show the list of all the garments of that<br>
type, which matched the parameters you entered, sorted by descending score.<br>
Once you explicitly select a garment, the compatibilities among this one<br>
and the other clothes will not be updated because the software thinks that<br>
you really know what your doing.<br>
</blockquote></p>
<p>
<blockquote>The other ways to modify choices are included in the context menu options<br>
explained below.<br>

<h3><a>2 Context menu</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote>These are the options listed when you long press a garment:<br>
<h5>3.1 Previous choice</h5>
Switches to the previous garment in the list of chosen ones if available.<br>
The compatibility constraints among the chosen clothes are computed once<br>
again to reflect the new scenario.<br>
<h5>3.2 Next choice</h5>
Switches to the next garment in the list of chosen ones if available.<br>
The compatibility constraints among the chosen clothes are computed once<br>
again to reflect the new scenario.<br>
<h5>3.3 Discard choice</h5>
The affeced garment will be excluded from this choice and the next in the<br>
list will be selected. The compatibility constraints among the chosen<br>
clothes are computed once again to reflect the new scenario.<br>
<h5>3.4 Update compatibilities</h5>
Opens a new form to enter a compatibility constraint between the<br>
affected garment and another one from the list of choices. At the end<br>
of the insertion, the new compatibility will be used to recompute the<br>
choices.<br>
<h5>3.5 View parameters</h5>
Opens a new view to show the parameter values referring to the selected<br>
garment.<br>
