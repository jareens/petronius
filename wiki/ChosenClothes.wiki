      This page shows the list of the clothes which were chosen. You can edit
      the choices as you like, see below, but remember that before exiting you
      should save the choices, otherwise they will not be recorded in the
      history archive and future choices will not take them into account.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are many ways to modify the proposed choices, one of them is to
     briefly press on a garment to show the list of all the garments of that
     type, which matched the parameters you entered, sorted by descending score.
     Once you explicitly select a garment, the compatibilities among this one
     and the other clothes will not be updated because the software thinks that
     you really know what your doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other ways to modify choices are included in the context menu options
      explained below.

      These are the options listed when you long press a garment:
      <h5>3.1 Previous choice</h5>
      Switches to the previous garment in the list of chosen ones if available.
      The compatibility constraints among the chosen clothes are computed once
      again to reflect the new scenario.
      <h5>3.2 Next choice</h5>
      Switches to the next garment in the list of chosen ones if available.
      The compatibility constraints among the chosen clothes are computed once
      again to reflect the new scenario.
      <h5>3.3 Discard choice</h5>
      The affeced garment will be excluded from this choice and the next in the
      list will be selected. The compatibility constraints among the chosen
      clothes are computed once again to reflect the new scenario.
      <h5>3.4 Update compatibilities</h5>
      Opens a new form to enter a compatibility constraint between the
      affected garment and another one from the list of choices. At the end
      of the insertion, the new compatibility will be used to recompute the
      choices.
      <h5>3.5 View parameters</h5>
      Opens a new view to show the parameter values referring to the selected
      garment.
