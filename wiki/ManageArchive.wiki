      This page lets you manage the exports of the archive. You can save all the
      definitions used by Petronius in a XML file on the SD card. The names listed are
      the XML files already saved. If you press on a file name, the data it contains
      will be loaded in place of your current archive: pay attention that all your
      previous data will be deleted; it's therefore wise to make a fresh backup before
      loading an export.
